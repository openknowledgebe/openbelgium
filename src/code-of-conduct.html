    <h3 class="h2">Quick version</h3>

    <p class="sessionsTitle">
      Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of
      gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
      ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference
      participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including
      talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be
      sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

    <p class="sessionsTitle">
      Open Knowledge Belgium is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate
      harassment of participants in any form.
    </p>

    <p class="sessionsTitle">
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
      orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual
      images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
      sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
    </p>

    <p class="sessionsTitle">
      Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised
      images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised
      clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
    </p>

    <p class="sessionsTitle">
      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem
      appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
      If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
      contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing
      branded t-shirts.
      Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement,
      provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
      conference. We value your attendance.
      We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social
      events.
